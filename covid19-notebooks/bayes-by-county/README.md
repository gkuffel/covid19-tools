- `<county>/cases.png` : Here we plot daily case counts over time, where the gray bars are reported cases and the blue curve traces the estimated number of true (i.e., reported and not-reported) cases. The darker and lighter shaded regions correspond to 50% and 95% posterior credible intervals, respectively. The sharp decrease in estimated true cases in the third week of March results from a similarly sharp decrease in estimated Rt at that same time due to the Illinois statewide lockdown intervention being put in place on March 21st.

- `<county>/deaths.png` : Here we plot daily death counts over time, where the gray bars are reported deaths and the blue curve represents modeled death counts. The darker and lighter shaded regions correspond to 50% and 95% posterior credible intervals, respectively.
